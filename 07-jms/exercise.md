# Oh, James...

Bruce is a rich orphan with a near-deaf butler called James. 
The loyal man wants to do everything to ensure the comfort of Bruce, but due to his bad hearing communication between the two is hard.
Maybe it would improve if Bruce put his requests on a queue that is observed by James...

1. Bruce is thirsty send an message to James so he can fix this. 
The Bruce in BruceRepository should have its field 'thirsty' set to false.
2. Bruce wants something to read. 
Send a message to James containing the name of the book Bruce wants to read. 
The Bruce in BruceRepository should have its field 'bored' set to false and the book he wants to read should be set on the third field.
